- I am interested in migrating from an automotive career to IT, where I already have a lot of knowledge (I have already developed software for use at Fiat and Jeep dealerships in Brazil).
- I am currently taking an Artificial Intelligence Automation Manager course from Xgrow (with Christian Barbosa), in addition to the Dio-Santander "Back-End Bootcamp with Python".
- In 2022 I did the Back-End Bootcamp by Alura, sponsored by Grupo BoticÃ¡rio - "programa Desenvolve 2022".
- YIN 2021 I completed a bootcamp including Linux, Shell scripting, systems architecture, container orchestration with Dockers, PostgreSQL databases, MongoDB, NoSQL, ETL with Python, Pandas library, Big Data tools, data engineering, and others hard skills. Currently I am studying Full-Stack at ALURA.
-  ðŸ‘€ I'm looking for an opportunity to work in IT
